# Prediction House Price using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and resources for predicting the House Price using machine learning. The project is based on the House Price Prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. I am submitting this as my Internship task at TechnoHacks EduTech.

# Objective & Data
The competition goal is to predict sale prices for homes in Ames, Iowa. You’re given a training and testing data set in csv format as well as a data dictionary.
# Training: 
Our training data consists of 1,460 examples of houses with 80 features describing every aspect of the house. We are given sale prices (labels) for each house. The training data is what we will use to “teach” our models.
# Testing: 
The test data set consists of 1,459 examples with the same number of features as the training data. Our test data set excludes the sale price because this is what we are trying to predict. Once our models have been built we will run the best one the test data.

# Tools
I used Python and Jupyter notebooks for this Task. Jupyter notebooks are popular among data scientist because they are easy to follow and show your working steps.

# Libraries: 
I Implore any budding data scientists to familiarise themselves with these libraries:

Pandas 
Scikit Learn
NumPy
Matplotlib

# Conclusion
After performing 5 different algorithms on the dataset, Random forest gave the best performance with 88% accuracy. So I decide to consider it for further evaluation.
